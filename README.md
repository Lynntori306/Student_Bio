# Student_Bio

finished rough draft of a three index webpage.
"Home" page consiting of a bio and pictures, effective use of colums and rows.
"portfolio" page I was unsure what to place here. I put a fake link card to my social media page.
"contact me" page placed a simple name box, email box, and comment section.
Ran into problems with making the layouts the exact same on each page. 
I learned a lot with this homework!
